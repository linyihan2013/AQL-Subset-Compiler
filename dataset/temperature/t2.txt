Temperature in Kathmandu plummeted back to 0.2 °C on Saturday, as recorded by the Meteorological Forecasting Division (MFD) at 3:00 am.

The MFD had recorded minimum temperature for yesterday at 2 °C reliving the Kathmanduites of the cold with maximum temperature 16.5 °C.

Temperature recorded at 8:45 am by the MFD is 3 °C.

Maximum temperature for today is expected to be around 16.8 °C with 93 per cent relative humidity.

Meteorologist Samir Shrestha at the Meteorological Forecasting Division attributed the dip in temperature to north westerly wind system dominating the Valley. “The minimum temperature is likely to dip further until there is a change in the existing weather pattern and western disturbance brings rain and moisture to the city.”

Meteorologist Shanti Kandel, on the other hand, said the minimum temperature in the Valley will not fluctuate much in the coming few days.

The average maximum temperature for the month of December is 20.2 °C while average minimum temperature is 3.7 °C.
